This `my_work` folder is a **sandbox** for your own experiments.

- You can put your own `.cpp` files, notes, and alternative designs here.
- Nothing in this folder is currently wired into the main `CMakeLists.txt`, so it **won’t affect** the existing `benchmark` target or the core `nyc311` library.
- When you’re ready, we can add a small `CMakeLists.txt` in this folder and hook up a separate executable just for your work.

Suggested usage:

- Start by copying small pieces of logic from `main.cpp` or `NYC311Analyzer` into new files here.
- Try out alternative data structures or experiments without worrying about breaking the main code.
